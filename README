   Qt5GuiTune is a port to Qt5 of a program (QtGuitune, GtkGuitune,
K2Guitune) written by Florian Berger (1999) and ported to KDE3 by Reinier
Lamers (2003).   Guitune is a really neat little tuner/oscilloscope
with some interesting mathematical dsp code.  I ported it to Qt5 for a
couple reasons: 1) to bring it up-to-date in terms of gui framework; 2)
to use as a basis for another project I have in mind.

   The application's GUI has been modified to be built on the QtCreator
framework, again for a couple reasons: 1) to make it more portable,
able to be built on any machine which supports QtCreator; 2) I wanted
to get familiar with the Qt tool to use on my next project.

I’m a retired programmer whose skills are pretty rusty. But if you have
any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.  I’ll do
my best to address them.
